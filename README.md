I created a NFT smart contract for Pokemon for fun. Currently, the contract needs to be deployed manually using Truffle and can be accessed using the Ganache CLI. This contract uses Solidity version 0.8.10 (must be the exact version of solidity running), and requires the installation of OpenZepellin contracts as those are unable to be uploaded to Github.

I am looking to make this NFT deploy automatically over the next few weeks using JavaScript.
